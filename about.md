# Hello!

You've found my blog!

My name is Ben Ashbaugh.
Most of the content on this blog is about interesting things I have found or implemented regarding parallel programming, and specifically parallel programming for accelerators, such as GPUs.  I am currently employed by Intel, though the content on this blog is mine.

In my spare time I enjoy running, hiking, and generally being outside.  When it's dark or cold I enjoy playing video games with my son.  When I really want to unwind, I enjoy doing the New York Times crossword puzzle with an old fashioned pen and newspaper.
